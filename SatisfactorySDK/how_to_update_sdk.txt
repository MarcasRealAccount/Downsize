How to update the SDK (In case I forget)
1) delete everything in this folder except this file
2) extract new SDK here
3) go to SDK.hpp and add this to it:
#include <Windows.h>
#include <Psapi.h>
4) go to each of the cpp files and add `#include <stdafx.h>` at the very top
5) go to FG_core_uobject_classes.h
6) find TSubclassOf and add this to it:
TSubclassOf(UClass* clazz) {
        this->Class = clazz;
}
7) done
